                <h1>ROHU</h1>
                <div>The rohu is a large, silver-colored fish of typical cyprinid shape, with a conspicuously arched
                    head. Adults can reach a maximum weight of 45 kg (99 lb) and maximum length of 2 m (6.6 ft),but
                    average around 1‚ÅÑ2 m (1.6 ft).</div>
                <div>The rohu occurs in rivers throughout much of northern and central and eastern India, Pakistan,
                    Vietnam, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, and has been introduced into some of the rivers of
                    Peninsular India and Sri Lanka</div>
                <div>The species is an omnivore with specific food preferences at different life stages. During the
                    early stages of its lifecycle, it eats mainly zooplankton, but as it grows, it eats more and more
                    phytoplankton, and as a juvenile or adult is a herbivorous column feeder, eating mainly
                    phytoplankton and submerged vegetation. It has modified, thin hair-like gill rakers, suggesting that
                    it feeds by sieving the water.</div>

                <h1>CATLA</h1>
                <div>Catla also known as the major South Asian carp, is an economically important South Asian freshwater
                    fish in the carp family Cyprinidae. It is native to rivers and lakes in northern India, Bangladesh,
                    Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan, but has also been introduced elsewhere in South Asia and is commonly
                    farmed.</div>
                <div>In Nepal and neighbouring regions of India, up to Odisha, it is called Bhakura.</div>
                <div>Catla is a fish with large and broad head, a large protruding lower jaw, and upturned mouth. It has
                    large, greyish scales on its dorsal side and whitish on its belly. It reaches up to 182 cm (6.0 ft)
                    in length and 38.6 kg (85 lb) in weight.</div>

                <div>Mrigal is popular as a food fish and an important aquacultured freshwater species throughout South

                    with roho labeo and the catla. The introduction to aquaculture across India started in the early
                    1940s and in the 1950s and in the 1960s to other Asian countries. The mrigal carp fails to breed
                    naturally in ponds, thus induced breeding is done.</div>
                <div>The Indian carps are considered as a delicacy compared to other exotic carp species also cultured
                    in Asia, and sell for higher prices. Reported annual aquafarming production numbers of mrigal carp
                    since the early 1990s have varied between 250,000 and 550,000 tonnes, with no clear trend. India and
                    Bangladesh are the largest producers. In Pakistan, this fish is known by the name of "Morakhi" or
                    "Moree".</div>
